Our project is a two-player Scrabble game with GUI. We adopted the official rules from 
here (https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules), but slightly modified it to reduce the project
complexity. 

Game play instructions are provided in the README and once you start the game in the "How to play?" section. 

To build the GUI we used JavaFX.
